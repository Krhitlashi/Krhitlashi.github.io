ɽ͑ʃ' is pronounced ɽ͑ʃ word medially (/ɽ͗ʃ is pronounced as ɭʃ' word initially. (Obselete))

ſן and ſɭп́ are sometimes pronounced ſɭ̀ (/q/), however ſɭɘ is the same.

No consonants are voiced. No vowels are rounded.

consonant clusters are never aspired and consonants in general never are unlike in Khmer or English.

There are no dipthongs. ꞁȷ̀ᴜꞇ is /a.i/ or /a.e/, ꞁȷ̀ꞇᴜ is /i.a/ or /e.a/. ꞁȷ̀ꞇ is only /e/ in those positions. Else, it is /i/

Nasal vowels can be pronounced as creaky voiced.

ꞁȷ̀ɜⅎ sometimes shifts to ꞁȷ̀wⅎ and ꞁȷ̀эⅎ as a result shifts to ꞁȷ̀ɜⅎ. 



Recently, vowels in a row became deleted. ꞁȷ̀ᴜꞇ became ꞁȷ̀ɹ (initially), or ꞁȷ̀ᴜ (finally) depending on the word (ꞁȷ̀ᴜꞇ j͑ʃꞇᴜ ſɭˬꞇ  becomes ꞁȷ̀ɔ j͑ʃɔ ɭl̀ᴜ ſɭˬꞇ instead of the expected ꞁȷ̀ɹ j͑ʃɔ ɭl̀ᴜ ſɭˬꞇ (Perhaps due to dipthongization). Similarly, -j͑ʃᴜꞇ becomes -j͑ʃɹ). ꞁȷ̀ꞇᴜ became ꞁȷ̀ɔ ɭl̀ᴜ. ꞁȷ̀ɜꞇ became ᶅſɹ initially and medially and ꞁȷ̀ɜ finally.



Velarized sounds seem to common for me. Some times ſןᴜ̩ ｡ ɭʃᴜ̩ ｡ ɭʃп́ ｡ ſɟᴜ̩ ｡ ſɟп́ ｡ ſɭп́ become velarized plosives. Similarly ſןᴎ ｡ ɭʃᴎ ｡ ſɭᴎ have often silent ᴎ or are pronounced as ejectives although the silent is more common.

During the time I was learning click languages, for some reason I couldn't not use them after I leanred them and they were easy to loan. Similarly, my conlang Ɓaʔutin <ō̆ſןᴜ ŋ̌ɿ̥ ɭʃꞇc̗ő> which was spoken in an Iikrhian colony also impacted this. As a result, Iikrhian has a set of clicks although they only account for a small percentage of words.



If clicks were to be lost, here is what would happen

ȏſן > ſןƽ ｡ ȏſןᴜ̩ > ſןᴜ̩ ｡ ȏŋᷠ > ŋᷠȝ

ȏɭʃ' > j͑ʃ'ƽ ｡ ȏɭʃ'ᴜ̩ > j͑ʃ'ᴜ̩ ｡ ȏ}ʃ' > j͑ʃ'ȝ

ȏſɟ > ſɟƽ ｡ ȏſɟᴜ̩ > ſɟᴜ̩ ｡ ȏſ͕ȷ > ſɟȝ



Nasals are often pronouced with a click word medially so ı],ᴜ ſ͕ɭᴜ 「ı],ᴜ ȏſ͕ɭᴜ」. It is mostly just ſ͕ɭ though. This may be actually a result of Lushootseed or Khmer influence. Lushootseed has no nasals which became voiced consonants and Iikrhian nasals arent voiced so they became prenasalized voiceless plossives and later clicks. Khmer spoken by me has these blocky sounding nasals where the nose would make a plosivey sounding thing like thnou |o̊ɭʃc̗őɜ̥ɿ̥| become n’noe |‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎o͗}ʃɜʌ| or something. Also implosives like in Khmer are also said with nasals as well. Either way it is how some things are pronounced. Sometimes in Iikrhian plosive x nasal equals click ſȷɜƽ ŋᷠɜ ɭʃᴜ ſןɹ j͑ʃᴜꞇ ſȷɜ 「ſȷɜƽ ȏŋᷠɜ ɭʃᴜ ſןɹ j͑ʃᴜꞇ」.





There are quite a few sound changes that can be attributed to a subconscious Khmer substrate. This includes the devoicing found in my version of Khmer (Ex. őſןᴜᴎ > ſןᴜꞇ) and attested in the transition to modern Khmer. Another influence may be the velarization of final consonants that is attested in my speech when I was a little kid. Another influence could be the deletion of a plosive after a nasal like ſ̀ȷᴜc̭ ſןᴜ to ſ̀ȷᴜ ŋᷠᴜ whereas Khmer ŋᷠɘőɔʌ > ŋᷠw ŋᷠɔʌ. This is also recorded in Surin Khmer őɭʃc̭ őſןɜ̥ʌᴎ́ > ɭʃc̭ɜ̥ʌᴎ́ ｡ ſɟc̗ őɭʃᴜw > ſɟc̗wʌƣ‎́.





Words were often shortened in the past and still are now. The loanword Akuɾuɳu > ꞁȷ̀ᴜ ſɭˬɜȝ. ꞁȷ̀ɜ ɽ͑ʃ'ᴜ > ꞁȷ̀ɜƴ. This is often random although long words (Three or more syllables) and loanwords are more often to be shortened. This also comes with phonological morphing that started as a result of conlanging with sound changes. This part still impacts me to this day. Old sound changes are renewed into new words. ɽ͑ʃ'ᴜ j͑ʃꞇc̗ ɭʃᴜ > ɽ͑ʃ'ᴜ j͑ʃɔⅎƽ.





In the past, Iikrhian distinguishes 3 types of clusters. Lushootseed syllables (Monosyllable) are like ſןƨᴜ without any spaces. Khmer syllables (Sequisyllable) are like ‎‎o͑ſןƨᴜ with a small minor syllable. Djaru syllables (Polysyllable) are like ſןw ɭʃᴜ which is just an inserted shwa. Then, the Djaru syllables merged with the Khmer syllables. In modern times, The Khmer syllables shifted again and are once again pronounced as a full syllable. Meanwhile, the Lushootseed syllables tend to be both sequisyllabic and monosyllabic. In reality the both the open ſןw ɭʃᴜ and the closed ſןƨᴜ can be pronounced as a sequisyllable and depends on the speaker (Whether or not with the new sound change. It is recommended to pronounce the Khmer syllables as sequisyllables and the Lushootseed syllables as quick monosyllables only). In reality many Iikrhian vowels are shortened and sometimes unvoiced in regular speech.

However, it wasn't always exactly this way.



In the past it restricted words to three consonant areas only. Similarly, the clusters were restricted to some letters. However at the same time at that time the final consonant could be any consonant compared to today. Later, many finals merged and words (Like newly created ones as well) became longer (Multiple syllables). Throughout the time, Iikrhian had a tendency to allow more clusters like j͑ʃᴜ̭ and ſɭc̗ as well as have more affixes. By the time there was more contact with Lushootseed, Austroasiatic languages, and Click languages, Iikrhian allowed sounds like ʃ ｡ ɭ( and ſ͔ɭ to be in clusters. During this time clicks were also introduced which at the time had no clusters. Later, this was changed and they can. After the period of influence, stranger clusters were allowed like ɭʃᴜ̩ ｡ and ſןᴜ̩. However, there are still prohibited clusters like ɭʃƣ̋ ｡ ɭʃƴ ｡ ſןƴ ｡ ſɭᴜ̩ ｡ ſןп́ ｡ ŋᷠƨ ｡ etc.. This will likely not change. However, the language has reached a point where having many monosyllabic roots is possible again which was the trend as affixes became more common. This is interesting as it is a natural change that occured along with and as a result of another change showing that these changes are interconnected.



The loss of some final consonants led to Iikrhian to develop a more polysyllabic structure which led to the decline of classifiers as they made words too long. The classifiers themselves likely led to the creation of the Iikrhian adjectival order which has influenced other aspects of Iikrhian grammar including the ſɭᴜͷ̗. As many adjectival compounds in Iikrhian became long, many roots were shortened. Similarly, this resulted in many affixes being created by what used to be the classifiers as well as particles. As words shortened, many words needed to be distinguished from sound, so more clusters became permitted. As final consonants became less important, they merged which caused more clusters and affixes to be created to create more words. At that time, affixes were favored over adjectival compounding. However, as Iikrhian vocabulary and affixation increased, the need for long adjectival compounds decreased leading to where Iikrhian is now.
