<p>Culturally and linguistically, Iikrhian can be very specific or very ambiguous. Some phrases are really inappropriate and even taboo in some cases.</p>
<p>Some terms are more specific and ambiguous.</p>
<p>ſɭɜ ſɭ,ɜȝ j͑ʃ'ɔ j͑ʃп́ꞇ ſɭɔƴ</p>
<p>skilled VBZ-song</p>
<p>Skilled singing</p>
<p>This reflects how myself in the past has gone against cultural norms which resulted in Iikrhian becoming more "universal" than other things which also made Iikrhian more closely aligned ideologically to loglangs rather than the many familliarized auxlangs.</p>
<p>However, there were a lot of Iikrhian cultural specific influences too and this increased as time went on. During the pandemic, it reach a climax as taboo was very strong and a lot of stuff happened to the language. As a result, it became really distict in this way.</p>
<p>To say new person, you would say</p>

<p>Perception of time and other stuff</p>
<p>Time is seen as bottom to top like the script. Timelines themself are said to appear linear, although the time it is created is random. It is believed that this randomness of occurences is infinite and as new worlds begin, old ones become less frequently occuring.</p>
<p>Because of this, new and old days are represented as next and previous days only compared to other languages. Note that next and previous is more imagined similar to a stack.</p>
<p>ſɭɔ˞ɜ ɽ͑ʃ'ᴜ j͑ʃᴜꞇ j͑ʃƨᴜ ſȷͷ̗ɹ</p>
<p>Next day (In the future)</p>
<p>ſɭˬɹ j͑ʃᴜꞇ j͑ʃƨᴜ ſȷͷ̗ɹ</p>
<p>Previous day (In the past)</p>
<p>However, despite this up and out are generally considered newer while down and in are considered older which matches soils and tree growth as well as the script. The reason why the time is different is due to how time is percieved by Iikrhians as being created at random whilst appearing chronological.</p>
<p>Direction was almost always based on north/south/east/west in the past. However, they have been used when refering to individuals as forward/backword/right/left based on the direction from the house couch. New terms have also been made to avoid ambiguity.</p>

<p>Continuing sentences</p>
<p>In spoken and sometimee written Iikrhian, the last part of the sentence is repeated to continue the conversation. Like this.</p>
<p>I went. Went to the house. Went to the house to get. In the house get the food</p>
<p>Repetition taboo</p>
<p>Repitition is not productive at all in Iikrhian with one exception.</p>
<p>A taboo can be reversed if it is said twice. This is only possible in nouns as adjectives might be rendered as a compound. Moreover, this deletes the word from the sentence meaning that the position will have to be replaced with a filler word or ilommitted if it includes a verb. Similarly, this means that the word cannot have adjuncts decribing it.</p>

<p>Adjective order (֭ſɭƨᴜ ſɭᴜ }ʃꞇ j͑ʃɔ ſɭ,ᴜ j͑ʃᴜꞇ)</p>
<p>The origin of this was to distinguish literal adjectives and symbolic adjectives as older versions of Iikrhian had a lower amount of vocabulary. The reason why the symbolic adjectives come after is because they are less important in meaning compared to the root. In the past as well, the number of words that could be stacked was much higher although this changed so that the only time this happened was with words what already had a modifier so that new words wouldnt have two and only one. For example ŋᷠɜⅎᶗ&lsaquo; ſɭэ j͐ʃꞇȝ ꞁȷ̀ᴜꞇ is a sandwhich while ŋᷠɜⅎᶗ&lsaquo; ſɭэ j͐ʃꞇȝ ꞁȷ̀ᴜꞇ ſ̀ȷᴜ ſɭɔͷ̗ ꞁȷ̀ᴜꞇ is a philly cheesesteak and it is a subset of sandwhich. Whats interesting about this is that this was a natural change meaning that this happened unconciously as i used to the language. Antoher part of this that is also natural is how what words were used in compounding changed as well where in the past compounds used to sould like whole sentences. Then, it became only adjectives with the - j͑ʃᴜꞇ suffix. Part of this was because in the past, Iikrhian did not distinguish adjectives from verbs and most words were verbs. That old version of Iikrhian also used classifiers intensily which could also be the reason for the development of the symbolic adjectives.</p>
<p>if describe, adjective first.</p>
<p>however, if compound, adjective last.</p>
<p>although i thought that this is a unique feaqure of iikrhian, there is evidence that khmer does it too. ពីរវ៉ាត់ two wats compared to វ៉ាត់ពីរ secon wat.</p>
<p>ſɭw ŋᷠw j͐ʃ j͐ʃэ ɭl̀ᴜꞇ ⺓ ſɭʞɹ }ʃꞇ j͑ʃп́ɔ ſɭɔʞ</p>
<p>in the past, what word would be the adjective would be determined by importance so that if it was a more visible aspect, it would be the noun. In modern Iikrhian it is by classification. However, the form is still presered in some words.</p>

<p>The subclause, -(a)l, cannot be stacked as a suffix.</p>
<p>*ŋᷠɹ j͐ʃ ꞁȷ̀ᴜͷ̗ ſ͕ɭw }ʃᴜ j͐ʃ j͐ʃɜ ʃɔ ſɭэ ı],ᴜʞ</p>
<p>You have to use adjective order for this.</p>
<p>Also for compound words, use it after the second word if you want to skip the next word.</p>
<p>ɭʃэ ſɭɔȝ ꞁȷ̀ᴜꞇ ֭ſɭw }ʃᴜ j͐ʃ ſɭᴜ ſןɹ j͑ʃᴜꞇ ſɭᴜ ɭl̀ɹ</p>
<p>rock-sai dark-al house-sai boat.</p>
<p>Coal house boat.</p>
<p>This separates taakeqai hoona from kapiisai. If you were to do it for taakeqai, then it would separate it from hoona.</p>
<p>There is no word for and. This is replaced by placing to words togther. If they are adjective, use -(a)l or kal.</p>
<p>Sometimes -sai can be dropped if another affox is used depending of what it is.</p>
<p>֭ſɭɹ ı],ᴜ j͑ʃᴜꞇ ŋᷠᴜƴ</p>
<p>without-move-sai human</p>
<p>֭ſɭɹ ı],ᴜ ŋᷠᴜƴ</p>

<p>This also ties to how adjectives used to be verbs.</p>

<p>ſ̀ȷᴜꞇ</p>
<p>ſɭw</p>

<p>they came while being cold</p>
<p>In certain cases, the ꞁȷ̀ᴜ ſᶘᴜ is moved to the middle which avoids ambiguity</p>
<p>ſɭɔ j͑ʃ'ɔ ꞁȷ̀ᴜ ſᶘᴜ ſɭw ſ̀ȷᴜꞇ</p>
<p>do.intent if come</p>
<p>If you come (Will eventually although not necessarily now), do that (If it happens) / Do that if you come</p>
<p>Verbs have slot in them and often this means ſןɹ j͑ʃɔ can be dropped.</p>
<p>ɭʃƽᴜͷ̗</p>
<p>ſɭɔƴ</p>
<p>ɽ͑ʃ'ᴜ</p>
<p>ſᶘᴜ</p>
<p>ꞁȷ̀ɔ</p>

<p>However, ſןɹ j͑ʃɔ is used when this is empty.</p>
<p>ɭʃƽᴜͷ̗</p>
<p>j͑ʃɔ</p>
<p>ſןɹ</p>
<p>ɽ͑ʃ'ᴜ</p>
<p>ſᶘᴜ</p>
<p>ꞁȷ̀ɔ</p>
<p>know piise they</p>
<p>Sometimes ſɭᴜͷ̗ is used to block it too like for adjectives to prevent compounding or close a verb that does not use the subject. Therefore, ſןɹ j͑ʃɔ is strictly a subject marker while ſɭᴜͷ̗ is used elsewhere.</p>
