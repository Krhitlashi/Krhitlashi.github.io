<p>Scientific Words and Numbers |ſɭɔ ſȷɜⅎ j͑ʃᴜꞇ ſɭɔʞ ſɭɹ ſȷɔ|</p>
<p>Numbers |ſɭɹ ſȷɔ|</p>
<p>Iikrhian uses a base 8 system that was prompted from tsacek where I would have to do this 2^n times. 2&sup3; was the most common. This was also reflected in the alternative numeral script which although is base 8, has a subsystem of base 2.</p>

<p>larger numbers use the open syllabic form.</p>
<p>ſןɹ ֭ſɭɔ sixteen</p>
<p>ı],ᴜ ֭ſɭɔ ſןɹ sixty six</p>
<p>The numbers could be compounded into larger forms like this. This idea was loaned from another conlang although I forgot where or what.</p>
<p>ſןɹɔ˞ ſɟᴜ ɭl̀ᴜ (ſןɹɔ˞ - + ſɟᴜ ɭl̀ᴜ) 8&sup2; which is 64.</p>
<p>ɭ(ɜ ŋᷠᴜ / - ꞁȷ̀ɜ ŋᷠᴜ is used for fractions.</p>
<p>Counting in</p>
<p>The development of the clipped and open sylabic forms of numbers actually occured naturally and just worked.</p>
<p>fingers works by not counting the thumbs. Once you reach 8, you start over and add a thumb. This should lead to 24 which was the old base for some reason.</p>

<p>Iikrhian Scientific Animal Names</p>
<p>These are similar to chemical names.</p>
<p>Personal Names |ſɭɔ˞ᴜ ſɭᴜ|</p>
<p>The concept of names were loaned back in sixth grade from the Warriors clans. However, this has changed over time as names became quite long.</p>
<p>Names are still composed of two separate parts. However, they can be shortened</p>
<p>j͑ʃɔ ſȷэⅎ ſɭᴜ ɭʃᴜ j͑ʃɔᶗ&lsaquo; |j͑ʃɔ ſȷэⅎ x ſɭᴜ ɭʃᴜ j͑ʃɔᶗ&lsaquo;| &gt; j͑ʃɔʞ ɭʃᴜ j͑ʃɔᶗ&lsaquo;</p>
<p>In the past, a person would have 5 different names which were your nickname, first name, group name, parent name, and family name.</p>
<p>Now however, only nicknames and first names are used. The others are still used by some however.</p>
<p>Nicknames are just the shortened normal names.</p>
<p>The use of clipped Iikrhian words is not limited to names. It is also used for some new words as well. Similarly names may be translated this way.</p>
<p>The first part of a name is always an adjective, so it has no -(s)ai suffix. The last part of a name is always a noun, so no -(a)ni suffix.</p>
<p>Language games |j͑ʃᴜ ı],ɹƴ ſɭɹ ſ͔ɭᴜ ᶅſɔ|</p>
<p>Vowel shift.</p>
<p>ſɭɹ j͑ʃᴜ ŋᷠꞇ &gt; ſɭɹ j͑ʃɹ ŋᷠᴜ</p>
<p>Similarly this can be vowel replacement of another word.</p>
<p>ſɭɹ ɭʃᴜ j͑ʃᴜ &gt; (ſɭэ ſᶘɹ ɭl̀ɜ) ſɭэ ɭʃɹ j͑ʃɜ</p>
<p>Also this can be seen to be similar to Semitic languages.</p>
<p>Poetry |ꞁȷ̀ᴜ ſȷw|</p>
<p>Generally, Iikrhian has its own style of poetry. However, it does have processes that are similar to other languages.</p>
<p>Repetition |ɭʃɜ ŋᷠэ }ʃꞇ|</p>
<p>Reduplication in Iikrhian in general is rare. However, it does appear in poetry and may be a result of influence from many other languages like Lushootseed or Khmer.</p>
<p>Repetition of words in sentences however, is regular in Iikrhian outside of poetry as well.</p>
<p>There are also expressions in Iikrhian like this that are native to the language.</p>
<p>}ʃᴜ ŋᷠᴜ ɭʃп́ᴜ }ʃᴜ ŋᷠᴜ</p>
<p>only i.twa only</p>
<p>ꞁȷ̀ᴜ ŋᷠɹ ſɭп́ᴜ ꞁȷ̀ᴜ ŋᷠɹ</p>
<p>but that.is but</p>
<p>ı],ɜ j͑ʃɹȝ ı],ɹ ſɭ,ɹ ı],ɜ j͑ʃɹȝ</p>
<p>exist friend exist</p>
<p>Hrlɔʔ prgap / Reverse words |ſɭɔʞ ſןɜ ᶅſwƽ ꞁȷ̀ᴜꞇ|</p>
<p>Hrlɔʔ prgap (Khmu word) can be found to some extant in Iikrhian mainly in word play. This practice originated from Khmer (Unsure of the Khmer word). It is often supplemented by a type of reduplication* found in Khmer. So words like ſɭᴜ ɭʃᴜ ſɭᴜ would be reversed as ſɭƨᴜ ſɭᴜ. Although these have similar meaning, it does not always have to be this way.</p>
<p>*The type of reduplication that was loaned is generally not used in poetry in Iikrhian as using different words is preferred. In fact the type of reduplication thing is considered a part of the vowel shift game mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Profanity</p>
<p>Iikrhian is more likely to have taboo words, there are unsuprisingly little profanity. Most of the time, a word is loaned from another conlang like Gulundic Skana or Verdurian Futa&scaron; or Wezayek Fujazi. This is used since it can be offensive for another people group which has been important to the Iikrhians for a while. In fact, there is a popular Loishə song called Fiishasi Fiitashai based from it.</p>
<p>However, if you want to use an Iikrhian word, you can say ı],ɹ ı],ɹ ŋᷠᴜȝ or normal-mind which just means stupid in the same way mousebrain does in Warriors. Aside from that there are not many ways to do so as this is not a core part of Iikrhian culture.</p>
<p>A true way to be offensive is to make fun of their name by using a similar sounding word that implies something rude.</p>
<p>However, in some cases, breaking taboo is offensive. It is not recommended though as they serve their purpose for protection.</p>

<p>Intially thought from Lushootseed tiia (var of there is) although it can also be from Khmer នេះ (var }ʃꞇwɤɘ̌). Because both seem to be vars and also similar to the Iikrhian version the true origin is not known. It may also be english as a vowel before n. It can even be said to be fully Iikrhian with the sound becoming nasal and then creaky to this which is documented in other words. Nonetheless it is usually used in fast speech.</p>
