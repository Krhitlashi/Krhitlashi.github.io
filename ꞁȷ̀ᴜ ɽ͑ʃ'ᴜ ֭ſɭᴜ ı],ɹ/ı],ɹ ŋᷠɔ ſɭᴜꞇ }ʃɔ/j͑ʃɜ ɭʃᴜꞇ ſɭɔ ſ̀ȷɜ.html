Its people seem to come from the same nala from a different planet with the same name (They believed that they were on the same planet) with the exception of a Feya (B'æghɛ̃) people who live near the equator. The planet is far away from many nearby systems and the closest of the Shaishaxi countries are Aisiakrhi and Loishə being closer to Aisiakrhi. Although some have attempted to claim the planet, none were successful. The people enjoy freedom from outside influence and remain relatively primitive retaining their traditional lifestyle with only four places that could be considered metropolises. Like Aurës, the people in the planet live in harmony and are strangely united despite the diverse cultures.",
      "Introduction ɿ": "All people call themselves the Khaydva which is Nitkhayts for 'Anybody'. However, each group has a name for their language, and culture. Only a few have a word for the people and this is only used to refer to the family lineage.",
