<p class=".miikef">Pronouns (}ʃᴜ }ʃꞇ)</p>
<p class=".ciihii" style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
<p>Iikrhian is a register language as shown below. Be warned; it gets complicated. Also note that Iikrhian is also an extreme pronoun drop language in some registers (Dropping normal nouns too).</p>
<p>Default Register Pronouns (ſɭ,ᴜ j͑ʃɹ ſ͔ɭᴜ ı]ɹƽ ꞁȷ̀ꞇ }ʃᴜƽ }ʃᴜ }ʃꞇ)</p>
<p>ɭʃп́ᴜ 1st (alone)</p>
<p>ɭʃᴜƴ 1st (affected by others)</p>
<p>֭ſɭwȝ 1st pl exclusive</p>
<p>ſɭꞇ 1st pl inclusive</p>
<p>ſɭɔƴ 2nd</p>
<p>ſɭɔƴ ſɭᴜȝ 2nd pl</p>
<p>ɭʃƽᴜͷ̗ 3rd</p>
<p>ſɭᴜ }ʃw 3rd pl</p>
<p>ꞁȷ̀ꞇ }ʃᴜ ſɭᴜ j͐ʃɔ 3rd (used when multiple speakers)</p>
<p>ɭʃᴜƴ refers to when someone else is involved compared to ɭʃп́ᴜ.</p>
<p>ſɭɹ j͑ʃᴜ ŋᷠꞇ ſןɹ j͑ʃɔ ɭʃп́ᴜ</p>
<p>love SUBCL i.twa</p>
<p>i love (animate).</p>
<p>ſɭɹ j͑ʃᴜ ŋᷠꞇ ſןɹ j͑ʃɔ ɭʃᴜƴ</p>
<p>love SUBCL i.tarh</p>
<p>i love someone / i love because of something.</p>
<p>ſɟᴜ ŋᷠɹ ſןɹ j͑ʃɔ ɭʃп́ᴜ</p>
<p>die SUBCL i.twa</p>
<p>i died (naturally).</p>
<p>ſɟᴜ ŋᷠɹ ſןɹ j͑ʃɔ ɭʃп́ᴜ</p>
<p>die SUBCL i.tarh</p>
<p>i died (by someone or was witnessed by someone (this depends on context)).</p>
<p>ɭʃп́ᴜ</p>
<p>j͑ʃп́ɔ</p>
<p>ſɭᴜ</p>
<p>ſɭɔ˞ᴜ</p>
<p>my name (chosen)</p>
<p>ɭʃп́ᴜ</p>
<p>j͑ʃɔ</p>
<p>ſɭᴜ</p>

<p>ɭʃᴜƴ</p>
<p>j͑ʃп́ɔ</p>
<p>ſɭᴜ</p>
<p>ſɭɔ˞ᴜ</p>
<p>my title</p>
<p>The second person is often dropped.</p>
<p>plural is optional.</p>
<p>Friend Register Pronouns (ſɭ,ᴜ j͑ʃɹ ſ͔ɭᴜ ı]ɹƽ ı]ɹ ſɭ,ɹ j͑ʃᴜꞇ }ʃᴜ }ʃꞇ)</p>
<p>ı],ꞇȝ proximal/first one speaking</p>
<p>ſ͕ɭᴜꞇ ŋᷠᴜ 1st</p>
<p>ɭʃɹ ŋᷠɹ distal</p>
<p>Example of ɭʃɹ ŋᷠɹ for 1st person is when you were not involved in an event.</p>
<p>ꞁȷ̀ᴜ ŋᷠɹ ſ͔ɭɔȝ ſןɹ j͑ʃɔ ɭʃɹ ŋᷠɹ</p>
<p>but eat SUBCL distal</p>
<p>except i was eating</p>
<p>Family Resister Pronouns (ſɭ,ᴜ j͑ʃɹ ſ͔ɭᴜ ı]ᴜƽ ɭ(ᴜ ſɭᴜȝ ꞁȷ̀ᴜꞇ }ʃᴜ }ʃꞇ)</p>
<p>ſ͕ɭᴜꞇ ŋᷠᴜ 1st</p>
<p>ŋᷠᴜꞇ ŋᷠᴜ 2nd (or someone in the family)</p>
<p>ꞁȷ̀ꞇ }ʃᴜƽ ŋᷠᴜƴ 3rd (usually outside of family)</p>
<p>Despite having many pronouns, Iikrhian is a pronoun drop language. Usually halfway within a conversation or in public areas, pronouns and names are dropped and are based on context.</p>
<p>Pronouns for games or roleplay or spectating (Not as yourself directly) (Indirect) (j͑ʃᴜ j͑ʃᴜ ı],ɹ̗ƴ }ʃᴜ }ʃꞇ)</p>
<p>Pronouns depend of the role you play. However, all must have a particle ᶅſэ attached. This is true in games too.</p>
</p>

<p class=".miikef">Word Order (֭ſɭƨᴜ ſɭᴜ }ʃꞇ ſ͔ɭᴜ ı]ɹƽ ꞁȷ̀ᴜꞇ)</p>
<p class=".ciihii">
<p>Word order is strictly VOS. Although kwa can change it a bit in translations only.</p>
<p>two piise cannot be in the same sentence. otherwise the sentence would be split or changed to have the same subject.</p>
<p>piise can be dropped if the verb is intransitive.</p>
<p>Sometimes the object and subject and the actions are considered the same (Mutual interations at the same time). This is shown in phrases like "The bird touched the fish" and "The fish touched the bird". This is done by indicating the participants beforehand, although most often this is dropped.</p>
<p>ſɭэ ɭl̀ᴜ ſɭᴜ ｡ ſᶘɹ }ʃᴜ</p>
<p>bird fish, touch.</p>
<p>the bird and the fish, they touched eachother.</p>
<p>Sometimes ramii is put where piise is for topic.</p>

<p>that is scary</p>
<p>Adjective order (֭ſɭƨᴜ ſɭᴜ }ʃꞇ j͑ʃɔ ſɭ,ᴜ j͑ʃᴜꞇ)</p>
<p>The origin of this was to distinguish literal adjectives and symbolic adjectives as older versions of Iikrhian had a lower amount of vocabulary. The reason why the symbolic adjectives come after is because they are less important in meaning compared to the root. In the past as well, the number of words that could be stacked was much higher although this changed so that the only time this happened was with words what already had a modifier so that new words wouldnt have two and only one. For example ŋᷠɜⅎᶗ&lsaquo; ſɭэ j͐ʃꞇȝ ꞁȷ̀ᴜꞇ is a sandwhich while ŋᷠɜⅎᶗ&lsaquo; ſɭэ j͐ʃꞇȝ ꞁȷ̀ᴜꞇ ſ̀ȷᴜ ſɭɔͷ̗ ꞁȷ̀ᴜꞇ is a philly cheesesteak and it is a subset of sandwhich. Whats interesting about this is that this was a natural change meaning that this happened unconciously as i used to the language. Antoher part of this that is also natural is how what words were used in compounding changed as well where in the past compounds used to sould like whole sentences. Then, it became only adjectives with the - j͑ʃᴜꞇ suffix. Part of this was because in the past, Iikrhian did not distinguish adjectives from verbs and most words were verbs. That old version of Iikrhian also used classifiers intensily which could also be the reason for the development of the symbolic adjectives.</p>
<p>if describe, adjective first.</p>
<p>however, if compound, adjective last.</p>
<p>although i thought that this is a unique feaqure of iikrhian, there is evidence that khmer does it too. ពីរវ៉ាត់ two wats compared to វ៉ាត់ពីរ secon wat.</p>
<p>ſɭw ŋᷠw j͐ʃ j͐ʃэ ɭl̀ᴜꞇ ⺓ ſɭʞɹ }ʃꞇ j͑ʃп́ɔ ſɭɔʞ</p>
<p>in the past, what word would be the adjective would be determined by importance so that if it was a more visible aspect, it would be the noun. In modern Iikrhian it is by classification. However, the form is still presered in some words.</p>
