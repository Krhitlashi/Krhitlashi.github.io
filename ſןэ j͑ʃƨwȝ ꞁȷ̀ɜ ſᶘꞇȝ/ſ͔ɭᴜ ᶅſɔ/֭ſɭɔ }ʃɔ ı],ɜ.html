    <ciihii class="ciihiicepai" style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
      The language spoken in Aisiakrhi, my personal conlang. The language has been shaped a lot by tsacek (hasaqai taboo), adjective ordering in compounds, and the creation of words and roots in general. It also has gone through a thorough removal of loanwords and calques to make the language more specific to myself. As a result, this language is different from the one used months ago.

      The register system in Iikrhian arose from avoidance taboo via tsacek where I would use different sets of vocabulary for different people.
      
      Also some new and old sound changes have started occuring again. Thus once again it is a language in the process of transition and change.
      
      One sound change that has happened as a result of the merger of finals into velar consonants is the process of paragoge. Words that would produce homonyms had an -a suffixed to them. After p or m, it would become -u (Later -ii). 
      
      Also, u used to be compressed, though during the loss of voiced plossives which initially caused the vowel afterwards to become rounded which meant the decompression of u.

    <ciihii class="ciihiicepai">
      Something cool and important to know is that language is highly influenced by its speaker and Iikrhian is not any different. It contains words for things you wouldn't expect to have words or roots for.

        (Cannonical lore for Shumekayne as well as some other stuff. Not true for Earth).

Throughout the years diifferent dialects emerged especially through Iikrhian isolation which affected Aisiakrhi internally as well.

However, due to the rapid decline of Aisiakrhi's power in the Shumekayne as well as in other places, dialectal variation only survives in Iikrhian Iikrhiahrhiisla. The rerise of Aisiakrhi was very quick and limited in size, so there wasn’t much time for change. Most dialects also have nearly the same phonology as standard Iikrhian due to isolation and purification. However, vocabulary was tolerated. This is one of the reason why many minority languages within Iikrhian territory survive (Compared to others of the Shumekayne) although influenced by Iikrhian.

Note that not all words are dialectal; some are just variants used in the main language. However, some dialectal variants were loaned into main language and vise versa, so it is unclear where many variants originated.
<br><br>
|ſ͔ɭ| is main dialect. |ꞁȷ̀ɜ| is known variant (Often used in compounds or names or other stuff).
<br><br>
ꞁȷ̀эc̭ őſȷꞇw > ꞁȷ̀э ŋᷠꞇ ɭl̀w |ſ͔ɭ| ｡ ꞁȷ̀эc̭ ſןꞇ ᶅſw ｡ ꞁȷ̀э ŋᷠɹ ɭl̀ᴜw ｡ ꞁȷ̀э ŋᷠꞇᴜ
ſȷͷ̗ᴜɘ > ſȷͷ̗ᴜƽ |ſ͔ɭ| ｡ j͐ʃᴜƽ ｡ ſȷͷ̗ᴜ ſןɹ ｡ j͐ʃᴜ ſןɹ
֭ſɭᴜƨ > ֭ſɭᴜ ɭʃᴜ |ſ͔ɭ| ｡ ſɭᴜƽ |ꞁȷ̀ɜ|
ꞁȷ̀ɔ ſᶘᴜ ɽ͑ʃᴜ > ꞁȷ̀ɔ ſᶘᴜ ɽ͑ʃ'ᴜ |ſ͔ɭ| ｡ ꞁȷ̀ɔ ſᶘᴜƴ |ꞁȷ̀ɜ|
ſןɹ j͑ʃɔ > ſןɹ ɽ͑ʃ'ɔ
<br><br>
The variants that are often used for compounds and other usage can be derived by a set of rules which mainly have to do with their ending. For example ֭ſɭᴜ ɭʃᴜ/֭ſɭᴜƽ ｡ ꞁȷ̀ɔ ſᶘᴜ ɽ͑ʃ'ᴜ/ꞁȷ̀ɔ ſᶘᴜƴ ｡ and ſɭᴜ }ʃᴜƴ/ſɭᴜ }ʃᴜ ɭl̀ɔ. Sometimes, this doesnt even have to be related to a sound change; ſɭᴜ ſןɹ/ſɭᴜƽ.

Sometimes words ending in -ꞁȷ̀ᴜ (if ɘ/c̭ then -ꞁȷ̀ɹ) are shortened in affixes. This is a result of sound changes partially reverting.
<br><br>
ſɟᴜ ɭʃᴜ j͑ʃᴜꞇ > ſɟᴜƨ j͑ʃᴜꞇ
ſɭɹ ſןɹ }ʃꞇ > ſɭɹɘ }ʃꞇ
<br><br>

Some dialects however preserve the old forms in affixes.
<br><br>
ſɟᴜ ɭʃᴜ j͑ʃᴜꞇ > ſɟᴜƨ ꞁȷ̀ᴜꞇ
ſɭɹ ſןɹ }ʃꞇ > ſɭɹ ſןɹ }ʃꞇ
<br><br>

In fast speech, the j͑ʃᴜꞇ suffix is shortened and the word is combined (ʌ shows word separation).
<br><br>
ſɭᴜ j͐ʃɔ ſȷɜ j͑ʃᴜꞇ ʌ ſɭэ ſɭɔ > ſɭᴜ j͐ʃɔ ſȷɜ j͑ʃ ſɭэ ſɭɔ
j͑ʃᴜƽ ꞁȷ̀ᴜꞇ ʌ ſɭэ ֭ſɭэ > j͑ʃᴜƽ ꞁȷ̀ᴜ ſɭэ ֭ſɭэ
ſ̀ȷᴜ ſɭᴜƽ ꞁȷ̀ᴜꞇ ʌ ꞁȷ̀ɜ ı],ɹ ſןɔ ᶅſᴜ > ſ̀ȷᴜ ſɭᴜƽ ɭl̀ ꞁȷ̀ɜ ı],ɹ ſןɔ ᶅſᴜ
