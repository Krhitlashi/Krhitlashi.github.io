      <p>Introduction</p>
    </ciihii>
    <ciihii class="ciihiicepai" style="font-family: system-ui;">
        <p>The language spoken in Aisiakrhi, my personal conlang. The language has been shaped a lot by tsacek (hasaqai taboo), adjective ordering in compounds, the creation of words and roots, as well as removal of influences. As a result, this language has vastly changed over time.</p>
    </ciihii>
    <ciihii class="ciihiicepai" style="font-family: system-ui;">
        <p>Iikrhian has gone through stages of natural and artificial change as the language has been used by me for a long time.</p>
    </ciihii>
    <ciihii class="ciihiicepai" style="font-family: system-ui;">
        <p>One sound change that has happened as a result of the merger of finals into velar consonants is the process of paragoge. Words that would produce homonyms had an -a suffixed to them. After p or m, it would become -u (Later -ii).</p>
    </ciihii>
    <ciihii class="ciihiicepai" style="font-family: system-ui;">
        <p>Languages are often highly influenced by its speakers and Iikrhian contains words for many things that I found important.</p>
    </ciihii>
    <p class="miikef">Dialects</p>
    <ciihii class="ciihiicepai" style="font-family: system-ui;">
        <p>(Cannonical lore for Shumekayne as well as some other stuff. Not true for Earth).</p>
    </ciihii>
    <ciihii class="ciihiicepai" style="font-family: system-ui;">
        <p>Different dialects emerged especially through Iikrhian isolation which affected Aisiakrhi internally. However, due to the rapid decline of Aisiakrhi's power in the Shumekayne as well as in other places, dialectal variation only survives in Iikrhian Iikrhiahrhiisla. The rerise of Aisiakrhi was very quick and limited in size, so there wasn’t much time for change. Most dialects also have nearly the same phonology as standard Iikrhian due to isolation and purification.</p>
    </ciihii>
    <ciihii class="ciihiicepai" style="font-family: system-ui;">
        <p>Note that not all words are dialectal; some are just variants used in the main language. However, some dialectal variants were loaned into main language and vise versa, so it is unclear where many variants originated.</p>
    </ciihii>
    <ciihii class="ciihiicepai" style="font-family: system-ui;">
        <p>|ſ͔ɭ| is main dialect. |ꞁȷ̀ɜ| is known variant (Often used in compounds or names or other stuff).</p>
    </ciihii>
    <ciihii class="ciihiicepai" style="font-family: system-ui;">
        <p>ꞁȷ̀эc̭ őſȷꞇw > ꞁȷ̀э ŋᷠꞇ ɭl̀w |ſ͔ɭ| ｡ ꞁȷ̀эc̭ ſןꞇ ᶅſw ｡ ꞁȷ̀э ŋᷠɹ ɭl̀ᴜw ｡ ꞁȷ̀э ŋᷠꞇᴜ</p>
        <p>ſȷͷ̗ᴜɘ > ſȷͷ̗ᴜƽ |ſ͔ɭ| ｡ j͐ʃᴜƽ ｡ ſȷͷ̗ᴜ ſןɹ ｡ j͐ʃᴜ ſןɹ</p>
        <p>֭ſɭᴜƨ > ֭ſɭᴜ ɭʃᴜ |ſ͔ɭ| ｡ ſɭᴜƽ |ꞁȷ̀ɜ|</p>
        <p>ꞁȷ̀ɔ ſᶘᴜ ɽ͑ʃᴜ > ꞁȷ̀ɔ ſᶘᴜ ɽ͑ʃ'ᴜ |ſ͔ɭ| ｡ ꞁȷ̀ɔ ſᶘᴜƴ |ꞁȷ̀ɜ|</p>
        <p>ſןɹ j͑ʃɔ > ſןɹ ɽ͑ʃ'ɔ</p>
    </ciihii>
    <ciihii class="ciihiicepai" style="font-family: system-ui;">
        <p>The variants that are often used for compounds and other usage can be derived by a set of rules which mainly have to do with their ending. For example ֭ſɭᴜ ɭʃᴜ/֭ſɭᴜƽ ｡ ꞁȷ̀ɔ ſᶘᴜ ɽ͑ʃ'ᴜ/ꞁȷ̀ɔ ſᶘᴜƴ ｡ and ſɭᴜ }ʃᴜƴ/ſɭᴜ }ʃᴜ ɭl̀ɔ. Sometimes, this doesnt even have to be related to a sound change; ſɭᴜ ſןɹ/ſɭᴜƽ.</p>
    </ciihii>
    <ciihii class="ciihiicepai" style="font-family: system-ui;">
        <p>Sometimes words ending in -ꞁȷ̀ᴜ (if ɘ/c̭ then -ꞁȷ̀ɹ) are shortened in affixes. This is a result of sound changes partially reverting.</p>
    </ciihii>
    <ciihii class="ciihiicepai" style="font-family: system-ui;">
        <p>ſɟᴜ ɭʃᴜ j͑ʃᴜꞇ > ſɟᴜƨ j͑ʃᴜꞇ</p>
        <p>ſɭɹ ſןɹ }ʃꞇ > ſɭɹɘ }ʃꞇ</p>
    </ciihii>
    <ciihii class="ciihiicepai" style="font-family: system-ui;">
        <p>Some dialects however preserve the old forms in affixes.</p>
    </ciihii>
    <ciihii class="ciihiicepai" style="font-family: system-ui;">
        <p>ſɟᴜ ɭʃᴜ j͑ʃᴜꞇ > ſɟᴜƨ ꞁȷ̀ᴜꞇ</p>
        <p>ſɭɹ ſןɹ }ʃꞇ > ſɭɹ ſןɹ }ʃꞇ</p>
    </ciihii>
    <ciihii class="ciihiicepai" style="font-family: system-ui;">
        <p>In fast speech, sometimes the -j͑ʃᴜꞇ suffix is shortened and the word is combined (ʌ shows word separation).</p>
    </ciihii>
