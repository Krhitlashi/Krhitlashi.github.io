      Aisiakrhi believes in Kamta E Rii which is a belief system that tries to be as inclusive as possible. It is very diverse and beliefs mainly involve ideas like matwana (you are yourself and only yourself) which relates to the idea of an angtungai (aqtiiqai (or in the modern lang, xiixe)) which is the reason why you are yourself and not someone else (It is not connected to you and is somewhat like is you were to watch a first person video of someone. This means that the aqtiiqai is an observer specific only to one (Although in some descendents of Kamta E Rii, this may be modifyable although unnoticable). Kamta E Rii is derived from Kamta E Tokii which views life only from the angtungai which meant that only one person is truly real (yourself) and that life is cyclitic based on your life and when you die you live life again in an endless cycle. It also states that other angtungais inhabit other people although their reality is completely different. There are also more extreme versions of Kamta E Rii like Kamta E Oo (pronounced ə) which was supported by the eclipse prophecy in Aisiakrhi and states that everything is the same thing (as ə) and nothing matters because of that (since everything else is an instance of it).
      Also there are many creation theories (ꞁȷ̀ᴜͷ̗ ſןwɔ˞ (aɬpəs)) as Kamta E Rii is mostly agnostic. One example is a religion itself, Kamta E Kfii. It states that the entire world is just one person's imagination (or worldbuilding project) and that all worlds will die when that person dies and each person is a part of a world within someone else's minds in and endless cycle and all will end when the creator dies.
      The base version of Kamta E Rii also is against things that spread or convert and so has mostly been voluntary. Also the version of Kamta E Rii used by the government influences the direction of society (For example it may have influenced nihilism in post scarcity Aisiakrhi).
      Kamta E Tokii (and many forms of Kamta E Rii) heavily have taboo systems like ſᶘᴜ ſɟɔƽ (tsacɛk) extending into many aspects of culture. Many rely on the idea of reciprocally which also is the reason why they do not have a trading based economy. 
      Others are more famililar taboo like loss taboo where you cannot mention someone who has passed. Similarly, this also means that photos must be destroyed, which is also the reason why Aisiakrhi has not returned to a post scarcity civilization as of now. However, mummification was practiced at some point although how that related to this is unknown. It may relate more to the general Iikrhian ideology of preservation (more on that later).

      Nayotara believes in ancestor worship and this shows especially in their architecture. They create statues of their ancestors that in modern times are where elders upload their minds to direct future generations. They believe that time of day should be mirrored closely which has led to an interesting form of building where each have auto dark mode where normally white buildings in the day become black at night. It slowly progresses to that color based on the time of day. This is called "time ambient color" by the Nayotarans and occur in everything including clothes, music, and food. In the past, people were told to fear nightfall (Also the main planet has no moon so no eclipses). Now, people are told that night and day have different properties and the length of day matters. They have a very developed astrology believing that even the local star systems you live in influence who you are as a person. In fact this is the reason why Nayotarans do not enter the fallen Anaasanan territories (Aisiakrhi does not enter as well due to similar beliefs as well as historical conflicts) (More on that later). They have developed the most accurate time systems. Their first time viewing an eclipse on other planets startled them deeply (More on that later). Culturally, they have always been interested in biological modifications from the start (More on how that impacts everything later). They use tattoos to signify personal achievements. Many people also do them themselves on themselves in a random pattern which is supposed to show who you are as a person. People of higher social status have done head flattening. Masks are a common way of communicating with spirits. It is also believed that certain materials and the maker will influence you as a person when you put one on.

      The Isawat live on a planet with the largest organism in the Shumekayne which is a tree that stretches throughout the entire planet. The tree has human level (Maybe higher) intelligence although until recently it is very slow to think. They believe that when a person is born, they are influenced by their environment and local guardian spirits which influence their birth. The tree has influenced many beliefs of the Isawat. For example the tree believes it was sent to watch over all living things on the planet and the Isawat sees the tree as the central guardian. Any damage done to it is considered the worst thing anyone can do and easily will become the enemy of many things on the planet (The Great Tree is respected by many animals as well). However, when asked, the tree will provide anyone resources if needed including its bark. The Isawat do not worship the tree itself and do not have a clear picture on who this supreme diety is and nor does the tree. They often enter domes created by its branches (Originally made for sheltering although still used as such) to ask it for advice. Modern technology has allowed the tree to be infused with nanotech which allow it to think and distribute resources much more quickly. Translation tech allows the tree and humans to communicate each other more naturally. Most importantly, since it was the only one of its species and thus one individual mind, due to colonization by the Isawat,  the tree now has relatives who are much more enhanced than it. This also provides the Isawat with a terraforming advantage as the tree is able to spand across many ecological niches. The planet of the Isawat is also home to other religions including Hemokeyuu which is a syncretic blend of Kamta E Rii (Aisiakrhi is very far. How that came here coming later) and another religion as well as the other religion iself based on the idea that the world is a complex song and actions must be done through dance (Isawat has always been a civilization that embraced music and street performances. Similarly, they believe in art in all aspects of life quite like Nayotara).

      The Omo are very diverse and this extends to religion as well. The Idoboih (Capital and mostly central power although not anymore) worships the king. When the modern Omo started, it would seem that this would fade away. However, many of the leaders are actually still descended from the royals although do not have the same divine authority as before. Modern Omo, they actually are no longer worshipped (Outside of Idoboih. In Idoboih, the believe in it very strongly). Originally, the religion likely worshipped many different animal forms for the leaders. However, the owl stuck. The Idoboih also believe in the moon and sacrifice in order to keep nights visible and days from being too bright. Owls have big eyes, and the moon is thought to be a gift from the owl's third eye while the sun is the eye of the lion spirit where the owl feathers (clouds) block the lion from being too bright. Coincidentually, a nomadic people called the Uza (Meaning liger) took over Idoboih during a lunar eclipse.
      The Oobemud (Modern descendants of the Uza and also part of the Omo) believe in one diety that created the world. This diety is not represented as it is very revered although Idoboih depicts it as an animal as this tied well with the Idoboih stories. The diety made the sun in order to bring life while the moon was an artificial invention by its creations (Interpreted as an influence from the Idoboih owl beliefs).
      The original beliefs of the Teihtoij are hard to uncover as most became involved with the Idoboih-Uza beliefs inserting themselves as cats. The original maybe related to cats as well. The modern story goes that cats were the first thing created and that the planet was just a large version of this cat for example the grass is fur and mountains are claws. Natural disasters are explained by the cat being distressed and is mediated by providing offerings.
      The ancestral Gugiŋŋã (Includes ʔAnanni, Yibarræ, and Idila peoples) belief system is based on multiple dieties and includes many creatures within folklore like the xuballe /xubaʎə/ who serve as assistants to the dieties. There is no central diety and all play equal parts and have unique abilities.
      In modern ʔAnanni, the beliefs are that these dieties are robots and cyborgs who were created by the original dieties to succeed them by using modern concepts and knowledge. The general belief (Which has spread to Yibarræ) is that parents and creators should put effort into making their children surpass them. The xuballe are reinterpreted as experimental projects from the original dieties before using mechanical components in the new generation. However, the xuballe are still respected as the original dieties are kind and the xuballe were made to be very powerful protectors.
      The Yibarræ originally moved their own path although now incorporates many values (Although not necessarily beliefs) as the ʔAnanni. They still worship the original dieties although aknowledge the existence of the descendants. Recently, a new belief was that one day humans would become the next generation surpassing them. However, it is still important to respect the originals.
      The Idila beliefs were very close to the original ones. However, the focus is much more on the xuballe while the original dieties were not active anymore.

      The Hubadhu Baʔi are somewhat similar to the Idoboih in that they believe that the royalty was related to divinity. However, the queen was not a diety and instead of one, there were multiple dieties. Moreover, Hubadhu Baʔi was a matriarchy. Each future queen would need to have a vision from one of the dieties and then explain how that relates to here becoming queen. Each diety had aspects of personality and an assigned element. These were Fire (F) who was serious although also naive, Water (F) who was calm and lazy, Wind (M) who was strong, quiet, hansome, and rude, Tree (F) who was smart, shy, although deaf and blind, Ice (M) who was lonely, and clueless, and Thunder (M) who was fast, greedy, and acts in the moment. Each city would choose one as their representative and each individual would have their own as well. They are said to control natural forces and relate to future outcomes
