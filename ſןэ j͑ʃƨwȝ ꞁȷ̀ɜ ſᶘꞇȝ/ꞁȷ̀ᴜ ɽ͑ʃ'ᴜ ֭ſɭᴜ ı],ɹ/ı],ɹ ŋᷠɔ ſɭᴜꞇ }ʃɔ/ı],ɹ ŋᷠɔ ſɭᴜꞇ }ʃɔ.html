    Current POV: Lmən, Isawat, Nayotara. <br>
    No longer as significant: Omo. <br>
    Less important: Aisaikrhi, Hubadhu Baʔi. <br>

    The Nayotara have the largest data centers in the Shumekayne. It has the greatest processing and searching of this information enhanced with some Iikrhian technologies. It currently is the most advanced in the Shumekayne. Nayotaran AI and data collecting extends far past the main galaxy and even extends into other worlds. For a long time it has not been the center of attention due to the one way absorbtion of information. Now it is very more vocal and has inserted itself into the world scene more directly. This provides the opportunity for others to learn from its success. <br><br>
    In the Omo, due to the shift towards the Yinamæ, the ʔAnanni were quick to recover. In fact, the Yinamæ can be said to support the recovery and the cultural and innovation center has shifted back to ʔAnanni. The rise of the ʔAnanni was welcome by many parts of the Omo and has also picked up support to Oobemud and the Im. Overall, the rise of the ʔAnanni helped the Omo strengthen itself and its unity albeit a bit differently. The Idoboih have also recovered although the government consists primarily of Teihtoij and Yinamæ now with a hint of ʔAnanni. Nonetheless, this inclusion of multiple parts of the union helped strengthen their bond. The Idoboih remained national heros and the leader of Idoboih is treated like a diety not unlike the former religion that had existed within that region in the past. Between Idoboih, Teihtoij, and Oobemud, power is evenly split in their sphere of the Omo. <br><br>
    A reflection of the past like the rise of the Oobemud, most production occurs within ʔAnanni and its sphere. ʔAnanni remains the largest populated territory within the Omo and is the most progressive with many others following it. Leadership in the Omo went away from the Teihtoij as it struggled to keep stability to Idoboih which ended up effectively fixing much of it. Later, it went to Oobemud which also tried to clean up and rebuild. During all of this, the central Omo leadership seemed to move towards ʔAnanni. Due to new prosperity and knowledge, all regions have equal chance to contribute to the central government if they prove to be effective. As things died down and Oobemud became more prevalent whilst adopting technologies from ʔAnanni, Oobemud became the center of culture in the Omo. <br><br>
    Although Anaasana has collapsed, it has left a legacy. Some examples include entertainment services like the Great Anaasanan Music Show. Culturally, it leaves behind celebrations and food in Nayotara and to a lesser extant Aisiakrhi. Politically, many now independant states were once a part of it although none have risen to a high status. Technologically it (and Aisiakrhi) have allowed Nayotara to become highly advanced. <br><br>

    <b>The Lmən</b>
    It had long been hypothesized that Lmən may eventually surpass the Hubhadu Baʔi. However since the revival and reconstruction, there had been not signs of this coming. Now, things are beginning to look promising for the Lmən as they became rich and continued to expand. Their goals have begun to be accomplished during a time of low production for both the Omo and the Isawat. Technologically they have surpassed Hubhadu Baʔi and designwise are on par or even surpass the ʔAnanni. Although they lack the major portal technologies of their neighbors they have or technologies and skills that allow them to compete very thoroughly in certain areas. <br><br>
    <b>Omodecline and the Shift upwards</b>
    The impact of previous war within the Omo had continued as the Idoboih sphere struggled to recover. Teihtoij has ran into its own local problems so have turned focus away from the federal government. The Idoboih themselves were still focusing on recovering. Even though the Oobemud have benefitted from the ʔAnanni sphere, it has slowed down recently. The Oito sphere pulls away from it as well. Now, the main controlling force is within the ʔAnanni sphere which remains strong. As Omo is a Idoni term, Gugiŋŋã is used to refer to the ʔAnanni sphere and as an extension, to this stage of the Omo (Gugiŋŋã Omo). However, the Omo have stabilized and have reached higher levels of quality and living standards. The Idoboih sphere has restabilized as well and the Idoboih remains in control in many parts of the government. Overall the dip was enough to move focus away from the Omo; however the Omo still retains its importance in many parts of the Shumekayne.
    The main focus shifted upwards (Based on maps). Meanwhile, as the Lmən progress, so did the Isawat. The Isawat have expanded further into former Anaasanan and Dehokal Junba territories. The Lmən have also spread their influence into the Louch, and have effectively taken over Dehokal Junba and Loishə. Within Din (Jantə), the recovered Hubadhu Baʔi has begun to revive a major project although this will take a while. <br><br>
    <b>The Isawat and the Anaasana Region</b>
    The Anaasan territories were left untouched by both Aisiakrhi and Nayotara do to a variety of factors. Both have cultural restrictions that prevent them from entering "impure" lands (Reasons are different for both countries). Aisiakrhi further has a long history and conflicts with Anaasana. The Isawat however, have no such restrictions and this allowed them to investigate Anaasana more as a civilization and learn from them (As well as expand the Isawat). <br><br>
    <b>Lugigaba</b>
    In the Omo, the southern Lugigaba people have became more of a significance as they have reformed themselves as a region within the Omo under the leader Maqawobu. Going so far as to take control of a whole southern ʔAnanni province. They were initially heavily inspired by the ʔAnanni although later they avoided it as it wouldve threatened their identity. Instead, they sent people to study in Oobemud where they brought a lot of Oobemud influences with them. The original Lugigaba language was one related to the Giŋgan Empire language although not descended from it. Later, most city Lugigaba spoke Yedila Omo Kalaa which then shifted to ʔAnanni Giŋŋã as they strengthened control over them. Now, The recommended languages of this region are Yùjigábáa Jĩgã, Yedila Kalaa, and ʔAnanni Giŋŋã. Modern Yùjigábáa Jĩgã is derived from the language of those that lived in smaller villages which already was heavily influenced by both Yedila Kalaa and ʔAnanni Giŋŋã (Including the ancestral influences from Giŋgan). <br><br>
    <b>Expanding</b>
    The Isawat have acquired the majority of Anaasanan territory and now are in contact with Nayotara. The Lmən have have developed vehicles with speeds reaching that of light while remaining not able to use portal technology. This has meant that they grew slower than the Omo and the Isawat. However, the slower growth allows them to focus more on quality of life improvements. They remain very rich in resources although not in data. <br><br>
    <b>End of the ʔAnanni Omo</b>
    The Idoboih have once again taken over the entire Omo. Except this time stronger as all parts became more friendly. Although the Omo is no longer relevant so that power is no longer important. There are still lot of influences from the Omo towards many. The Omo are also important again in a way like other countries as Nayotara is. Moreover, now the Omo are a true union. <br><br>
    <b>The Isawat Stop Advancing</b>
    Technology has advanced quicker than systems. In the past, elders were wiser than other people. Now everyone is able to learn everything from the tree. Furthermore most people have long lives so younger people could be wiser. Also, the Treespeaker is no longer as unique since everyone can access the tree so the Treespeaker is now a normal leader. <br>
    The elders were concerned. The wanted to stop making new things so that they can improve quality. So the Isawat no longer are changing as fast. <br>
    Even though the Isawat and the Omo are less important, the Lmən can continue to improve without them. <br><br>
    <b>Changes</b>
    The Lmən expanded a lot. After the collapse of the Omo, the Lmən anx the Hubadhu were able to take control of parts of it. Now the Lmən are able to use portal technology although not create it. <br>
    The Isawat gone through reforms. However, leadership had not change and only the systems have. Nonetheless, they are smart and wise as they knew the collapse of many civilizations and as a result they would continue. <br>
    <b>True Collapse of the Omo</b>
    The Lmən took over a large part of the Omo because some Idoih attacked othee parts of the Omo. The attacked because they wanted to spread the original Idoih way of life. Afterwards, those who were attacked went to the Lmən for help with the country. So, the Lmən took over part of Idoboih. <br>
    However, some Idoih didn't like that. So they tried to start a rebellion. Although during the planning, the Oobemud stopped it from happening. They also spoke to the Lmən to regain the Omo territory back. However, the Panano attacked Oobemud. They also took over many parts of the Omo. They even started rebellions in other countries. Eventually, the leaders of Idoboih, Oobemud, and Panano spoke together. They agreed to end this by giving the land of all three to the Lmən.
