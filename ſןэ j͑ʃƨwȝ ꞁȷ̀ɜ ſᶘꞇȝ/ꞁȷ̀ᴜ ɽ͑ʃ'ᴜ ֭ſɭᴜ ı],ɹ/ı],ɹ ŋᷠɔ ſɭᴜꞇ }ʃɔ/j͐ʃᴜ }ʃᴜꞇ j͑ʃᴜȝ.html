    Unlike other planets, Lhanaisan started off in another nala with no external Iikrhian contact, meaning the Iikrhians here are indigenous to this planet. It became an Iikrhian colony once Aisiakrhi was able to contact this area. Contact was only able to happen two times. Once when it first became a colony, and second once it has been discovered.

  <p class="miikef">Introduction</p>
  <ciihii class="ciihiicepai" style="flex-direction: column; font-family: system-ui;">
    Lhanaisan (Maybe Lam 'North' + -ai + Shan 'Snow') was an Iikrhian colony that started before the fall of Aisiakrhi. It was also the last colony made before isolation. For many years after no contact, the Lhanaisan people relied on fishing and life around the water. No cities were built although they had buildings around the shore. They lived life in an abundant world and there was no need for technological progress. Their language was recent as they were the last colony.
    <br><br>
    Although the Iikrhians thought they were the first to be on the planet, many other peoples live there before. Like in other places in the Shumekayne, these people were endemic to the planet with cultures and languages not existing elsewhere. Initial genetic tests show that the people originated from three seperate nalas with little overlap between them.
    <br><br>
    However, after Aisiakrhi rose again, Lhanaisan was taken under Iikrhian control. The natives switched to standard Iikrhian and now recognized territory as being claimed. Their lifestyle however, remained the same. Despite that, they started to explore more of the land.
    <br><br>
    In the time that Aisiakrhi returned, other colonists came. The Skatu Iikrhians (0% Skatu) came and found a lush cave to live in. Although the Skatu are genetically extinct, their culture lived on as many Skatus adopted Iikrhian children and nearby Iikrhians (On the Skatu island) adopted their culture as well. They have been less affected by Iikrhian purification due to their isolation from the main lands and also the general isolation in Iikrhian society during the purification period. The Skatu colony in Lhanaisan became 'Kaato Kanadi' which was named after the Cotto Canadi country that the Skatus ruled before Aisiakrhi came. The language of the Skatus in Lhanaisan is a dialect of Skatuan Iikrhian.
    <br><br>
    Another group that arrived in Lhanaisan were the Guuni, who were the descendants of Ghoulund. Although these descendants came from Loishə, they spoke neither Guuni Shiva or Loishə Khayyi, but rather a creole known as Gulun Hyashuk which is a mix between Guuni Shiva, Loishə Khayyi, Iikrhian, the local Bliat village language as well as a few other languages. The creole arose as the Iikrhians initially denied them access to the planet as it was an Iikrhian colony. However, as they were a minority group and had a cultural significance in Iikrhian history, they were allowed to come. The colonizers settled in a land where a village already existed (An indigenous group). With support from Aisiakrhi instead of Loishə, a pidgin developed to facilitate the set up of the colony which was rocky at first. This wonkiness of the initial setup lasted long enough for the pidgin to creolize, and by the time Iikrhian support ended, the Guuni colonists spoke only the creole. The colony is called 'Gulun Ukeoseong' where Gulun which was the old word for Ghoulund in Itanis and Ukeoseong which was from Iikrhian Xkaasaaq meaning planet colony. Their terriory is a village and and island.
    <br><br>
    The Iikrhians only intervened in the planet to send dictionaries to the Lhanaisan Aisiakrhi colony so that the language does not diverge too much. Despite these efforts, due to the substrate of the previous Lhanaisan Iikrhian language, as well as the isolation from main Aisiakrhi, the dialect has a high chance of diverging. Now, no dictionaries are sent and Lhanaisan is only observed. 
    <br><br>
    After the sudden revival of Lhanaisan as a colony, the Iikrhians stopped producing any new colonies with the exception of space habitats. As a result, this remains the last colony of Aisiakrhi and is under Iikrhian supervision.
    <br><br>
    Like all Iikrhian colonies where contact is cut off on, Lhanaisan people as well as the other colonists are no longer aware of their origins outside of the planet as this knowledge ceased to be passed on. Currently the status of this nala and the people are unknown as the connection to the shumekayne was lost.

  <p class="miikef">Similarities to Aisiakrhi's Past</p>
  <ciihii class="ciihiicepai" style="flex-direction: column; font-family: system-ui;">
    The languages in many ways seem to mirror those of the Kape Atze. Gulun Hyashuk is similar to Edo because it is a language that has replaced a native language of a village although was highly impacted by it. Chashi' E Kanadi is similar to Ataraxian in that it is a descendant of Iikrhian spoken by a people who have been supplanted by the Iikrhians and have found a new home elsewhere. Even the names of Kato Kanadi and Ataraxia come from the names of the countries and peoples that once spoke the extinct languages. Lhanaisan Iikrhian and the Ayasi Iikrhian languages are similar in that they were both directly supported by main Aisiakrhi and spoke (or used to) really conservative forms of Iikrhian that are closer to standard Iikrhian than the neighboring languages.
    <br><br>
    The situation is similar to that of the Ancient Planet in that it involves some of the main players which were Iciacree (Represented by Lhanaisan Aisiakrhi), Ghoulund (Represented by Gulun Ukeoseong), and Cotto Canadi (Represented by Kato Kanadi) although this doesn't include Disafusafia or Bea. This in turn mirrors how the Kape Atze resembled ancient Iikrhiahrhiisla which has Aisakrhi and Ataraxia. Other resemblences include Bea, and Ice Oceans.
    <br><br>
    The overview of the world and interactions resembles that of Nocidai. People will work together although sometimes go separate ways and work alone. Another similarity is that both are relitively primitive. However, with the contact with main Aisiakrhi and colonists (After not being alone anymore), civilization suddenly progressed quicker with people already reaching the iron age (Although compare how Kape Atze diamonds were discovered. Also, for Gulun this was because of help from Lhanaisan Aisiakrhi).

  <p class="miikef">Last Iikrhian Colony (Before Eclipse Aisiakrhi)</p>
  <ciihii class="ciihiicepai" style="flex-direction: column; font-family: system-ui;">
    To the Iikrhians, the colonization of Lhanaisan was a disaster. Not only did they cause they extinction of two cultures by suplanting it with Iikrhian, they also forced a people to become standardized who, although Iikrhian in ancestry, had developed a distinct identity. They neglected the Skatu and discouraged them from speaking their dialect of Iikrhian which resulted in Kato Kanati to cut ties and not be supported by Aisiakrhi in the beginning.
    <br><br>
    When the Iikrhians decided to restore Ghoulund and revive their culture, they forgot about the people who already had a home. Although the goal was to preserve a culture, they destroyed both instead because they did not pay attention to their actions. They became what they disliked and enforced rules that were not wanted or fair. Thus, the Iikrhians decided that it was better to let go of what died naturally than to revive something that was meant to end artificially. So ended the chapter of Iikrhian colonization.

  <p class="miikef">Languages</p>
  <ciihii class="ciihiicepai" style="flex-direction: column; font-family: system-ui;">
    Calques are common between the three languages and are often Iikrhian style compounds. Although Kato Kanadi and Gulun Hyashuk have a lot of non-Iikrhian vocabulary, Iikrhian vocabulary is used for coumpounds with Iikrhian words although mixing does occur especially with the lower classes.
