  <ciihii class="ciihiicepai" style="flex-direction: column; font-family: system-ui;">
    The etymology of Nadzatom (ő}ʃᴜ őɭ̀ʃ'ᴜ ɭʃɜ̥c̭ő) is unknown. It is a planet far away from major countries although close to Loishə which usually does not bother with neighbors.
    <br><br>
    It has one major supercontinent stretching from the north to south. Much of the interior is desert which seperates the two hemispheres.
    <br><br>
    In many ways it is similar to the Wavamou who existed within Dehokal Junba and now are extinct. The planet is also similar to Sotayqeyglo in that most people have remained primitive for a long time. However, recently that has changed.
    <br><br>
    Some language spoken on this planet are
    <br>
    Kʷə̀xʷíɁ - A dominant language family stretching from one end of the supercontinent to another.
    <br><br>
    As the Loishə sphere has been replaced by the Omo sphere, some regions within the planet has been absorbed into the Oito subsphere. As the Omo sphere declined, the planet has since been left alone although some Oito remain present.
